      <h1>Privacy Policy for Linksi</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Linksi. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you participate in the internal testing of our mobile application ("App").</p>
      <p>This policy is intended for our internal testers and the Google Play review team to understand the data processing activities within this pre-release version of the App.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>Because this is a testing build, we collect information primarily to ensure the functionality of the app and to identify and fix bugs. The data we collect includes:</p>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>When you sign up and log in via Firebase Authentication, we collect your basic account data, such as your email address and a unique user ID (UID), to identify you and provide access to the service.</p>

      <h3>User-Generated Content (Calendar Data)</h3>
      <p>We collect the data you create within the app. This includes event titles, notes, start/end times, color choices, and recurrence rules (rrule). This data is necessary for the core functionality of the calendar.</p>

      <h3>Technical and Crash Data</h3>
      <p>We automatically collect technical information to help us diagnose problems and improve the app. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Information about crashes and other errors, including device state at the time of the crash.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> Anonymized data about app performance, such as launch times and network latency.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic, non-personally-identifiable information about your device (e.g., OS version, device model).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Your account and calendar data are used to deliver the core features of the App, such as creating, displaying, and managing your events.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve and Debug the App:</strong> Crash reports and technical data are essential for us to identify bugs, fix stability issues, and improve the app's performance before a public release.</li>
        <li><strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> We may use your email address to send you updates about the testing process or to ask for feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We only share your data with the following third-party service provider, which is essential for the App to function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Google Firebase for backend services, including authentication, database (Cloud Firestore), and crash reporting (Crashlytics). Your data is stored on Google's secure servers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will not share your data with any other third parties, except as required to comply with the law.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. All data is transmitted over secure (HTTPS) channels, and we rely on the robust security infrastructure of Google Firebase to store and protect your data.</p>

      <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or wish to request the deletion of your data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:519technology@gmail.com">519technology@gmail.com</a></p>
